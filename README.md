# Image Recognition Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build an image recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system can classify images into different categories based on a dataset of labeled images. It uses deep learning techniques for training and predicting image labels.

## Features
- Image classification using CNNs
- Preprocessing pipeline including image resizing, normalization, and data augmentation
- Customizable architecture with options to modify layers, activation functions, etc.
- Training, evaluation, and inference modules
- Support for GPU acceleration with TensorFlow or PyTorch

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-recognition.git
   cd image-recognition


2. Install the required packages:

               pip install -r requirements.txt


## Dataset

The project expects a folder structure where the training data is stored in subfolders for each category.


                data/train/cat
                data/train/dog
                data/test/cat
                data/test/dog


You can use any labeled image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet, or a custom dataset). Make sure the images are placed in corresponding subdirectories representing their class labels.



## Usage

1. Training the Model
 Train the CNN model on your dataset:


         python src/train.py

The script will:-
1. Load the training images from the /data/train directory.
2. Preprocess the images (resize, normalize, augment).
3. Train the CNN model on the training dataset.
4. Save the trained model weights.

   
2. Evaluating the Model
   
Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the test dataset:


              python src/evaluate.py

   
This will load the test images from the /data/test directory and compute evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

3. Predicting New Images
   
Use the trained model to classify new images:


       python src/predict.py --image path_to_image.jpg

       
The script will load a single image, preprocess it, and output the predicted class label.


## Testing

Unit tests are provided to ensure that the core functions of the CNN model and utilities work as expected. Run the tests using:


                python -m unittest discover -s tests


## Requirements

The project uses deep learning frameworks like **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**, along with additional libraries for image processing. You can install the required dependencies by running:


                                  pip install -r requirements.txt


**Required packages:**

1. tensorflow or pytorch
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. opencv-python
5. scikit-learn

   
## Future Enhancements

1. **Transfer Learning:** Add support for transfer learning using pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet, or MobileNet.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Implement grid search or random search for optimizing hyperparameters.
3. **Real-time Image Recognition:** Add a feature to classify images in real-time using webcam input.
